### About myself
Nowadays I work as an economist at a bank. It’s a great job. But I always feel that I like automation of any task more than analysis of paying capacity of companies. I really want to realize myself as a developer.
I'm 40. I live in Brest. I've got 2 sons (6 and 8 years). 
I'm absolutely ready for a new job as a developer and I'm going to make my best in this profession.

          let pos = -1;
          let count_letter = 0;
          while ((pos = lowwer_text.indexOf(char, pos + 1)) != -1) {
            count_letter++;
          }
          console.log(char + '  ' + count_letter + '  ' + allredy_analized);
